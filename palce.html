        <h4>Raja Dinkar Kelkar Museum</h4>
        <p>It is the one-man collection of Late Dr. D.G. Kelkar (1896 -1990). 'Kaka', as Dr. Kelkar was affectionately known dedicated his collection to the memory of his only son `Raja’ who died an untimely death. It is a collection about 22,000 priceless artifacts which mirror the everyday life of India. A testimony to man’s creative spirit - the spirit that breaths beauty into the banal, and puts romance into the mundane. Kaka was a man obsessed with art. A man who, for over sixty years, traveled extensively across the country - to obscure villages and tribal settlements, to grand temples and humble huts, to forgotten attics and folk fares - collecting .. always collecting.</p>

        <h4 >Sarasbaug</h4>
        <p>Saras Baug is a popular attraction in Pune which was initially a lake at the foothills of Parvati. As the water of the lake dried up, the exposed land was developed into a park and was named Saras Baug. The attraction expands over an area 25 acres and also has a temple in the centre. The shrine is dedicated to Lord Ganesh and because it was built in the middle of a lake, it is also called Talyatla Ganpati. The baug and the temple also have some historical significance as they were built during the time of the Peshwa. The temple, in particular, has been an important venue for several historical events too.At Saras Baug, one can explore the lush green lawns which are often trimmed and well-maintained.</p>
